## APPLICATION DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

The directory structure of a Django application follows a standardized layout to organize its components and files. Here's a breakdown of a typical Django application directory structure:

```
app_name/
├── migrations/
|   ├── __init__.py
|
├── templates/
├── static/
├── __init__.py
├── admin.py
├── apps.py
├── models.py
├── tests.py
├── views.py
└── urls.py
```

Let's explain each component of the directory structure:

1. `migrations/`:
    + This folder contains `__init__.py` which means it's a python package.
    + It also contains all files which are created after running makemigration command.
    + This directory holds the database migration files generated by Django's migration framework.
    + Migrations are used to manage changes to the database schema over time.

4. `__init__.py`:
    + This is an empty file that marks the directory as a Python package, allowing us to import modules from it.

5. `admin.py`:
    + This file is used to register sql tables so we could perform CRUD operation from Admin Application.
    + Admin Application is provided by Django to perform CRUD operation.
    + This file is used to customize the Django admin interface for the app's models.
    + We can define how the models are displayed and managed in the admin panel.

6. `apps.py`:
    + This file holds the app's configuration.
    + We can modify the default behavior of our app by subclassing the `AppConfig` class in this file.

7. `models.py`:
    + This is where we define the data models for the app using Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system.
    + Models represent the structure of our data and are used to interact with the database.
    + It is used to create our own model class these classes will be converted into database table by Django.

8. `tests.py`:
    + This file is used to write unit tests for the app's functionality.
    + Writing tests helps ensure our app behaves as expected and remains stable during development.

9. `views.py`:
    + This is where we define the views (web pages) for the app.
    + Views handle HTTP requests, process data, and return HTTP responses, often rendering templates.
    + We write all the business logic related code in this file.


The directory structure is designed to keep our app's components organized and modular. We can customize this structure to match our app's needs, but following these conventions helps maintain consistency and makes it easier for other developers to understand and work on our code.
