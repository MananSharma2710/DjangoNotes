## GET and POST

**GET Method**:
- **Description**: `GET` is a method used to request data from a server. It's used when you want to retrieve information from a server without making any changes on the server's side.
- **Usage**: Typically used when you're fetching data, like reading articles, viewing images, or searching for information. When you type a URL into your browser's address bar and press Enter, you're making a `GET` request.
- **Data Handling**: Data is appended to the URL as query parameters. The data is visible in the URL and can be bookmarked, shared, and cached.
- **Caching**: `GET` requests can be cached by browsers and proxies, which can improve performance.

**POST Method**:
- **Description**: `POST` is a method used to submit data to be processed by a server. It's used when you're sending data to the server to create, update, or modify resources.
- **Usage**: Commonly used for submitting forms, like creating a new user account, submitting comments, or making a purchase. `POST` requests are used for actions that modify data on the server.
- **Data Handling**: Data is sent in the body of the request and is not visible in the URL. This makes it more suitable for sensitive information.
- **Caching**: `POST` requests are typically not cached due to their potential side effects on the server's state.

In Short:
- `GET` is for retrieving data without modifying anything on the server. It appends data to the URL and is cacheable.
- `POST` is for sending data to the server to create or modify resources. It sends data in the request body and is not cacheable.
